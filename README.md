# Citibank-Housing-Loan

# Summary
Our solution is powered by Machine Learning and based on rules and regulations of the Housing and Development Board (HDB) in Singapore. The core function is to use our model to and heuristics from the HDB’s Housing Loan Policies in order to evaluate the customer’s financial position and estimate the most suitable house pricing bracket for them. Consequently, we enable them to sort and filter houses based on their preferences within the previously determined price bracket. Thus, our application is an essential assistant in the house purchase process of customers.

# Setup
Our source code is in the form of a Google Colaboratory Notebook. The model training data should be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ppaD0XZUMHzVqZRa90rGYNGpJ_47Vc7C/view?usp=sharing
and unzipped. Consequently, further no setup is needed other than opening the notebook and executing the cells in sequential order.
